/**
 *Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is.
 * If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again." 
 * If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again." 
 * The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.
